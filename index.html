      <h1>Course Reflection:</h1>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>I came into this course thinking that it would be a waste of time. After all, I had already taken both AP English Language and AP English Literature, and passed both with 5’s on the exams. My initial assessment of the course was that it was designed by FSU to squeeze more money out of students who had earned too many credits from AP/IB courses, making it more profitable to keep these students in the college. I had very low standards for this entire course, and at the beginning of the semester, I decided I would find a new way to look at the course so it didn’t feel like absolute torture the entire time. Thus began the plan to over-engineer literally every project assigned to me during this course. <br>
        <br>The first project was a simple research project, doing basic research on a topic I was interested in. In my case, this topic happened to be open source security. I chose this specific topic because not only did I want an interesting topic, I wanted to genuinely learn something from this assignment. Due to this drive, I actually ended up learning a lot about the origins of open source software and its explosion in popularity. My nearly 8 page essay delved into a variety of topics, ranging from the origins of open source software, the security it typically implements, and the user base it attracts; however, despite this in-depth analysis, I ultimately had to cut out various parts I wanted to initially include in my original final draft to make the essay more concise and attractive to the reader. <br>
        <br>The second project in this course was a rhetorical analysis of two sources of our choice, although the topic had to be the same. Rhetorical analysis has been one of my favorite parts about writing ever since my AP English Language professor in high school introduced me to a unique approach to rhetorical analyses: argue, refine, repeat. The entire premise of this approach is to choose a unique, strange position to argue based on the given literary piece, then as you argue that point, refine it just enough to make it align with the literary piece’s content, without completely changing the basis for your argument. I was enamored with this approach, and found it completely fascinating while I was in high school. My professor loved to teach his students this approach because he found that it helped his students score higher on the AP exam. His explanation for this was “Instead of focusing on attempting to find the ‘right’ argument, you can spend more time making your argument the right one.” I utilized this exact approach in my second project. I wanted to contrast my two artifacts by making the first one (The Washington Post news article) seem drab and lifeless, while making the other (TechLinked video clip) seem filled with emotion. I was able to argue this position because I looked for specific points in each artifact that could support my overall argument, instead of looking for generic appeals that could lead me to a broad conclusion. <br>
        <br>The third project was, quite honestly, one of the tamest projects in this course. I was unable to do as much as I initially wanted with this specific project, because my other classes got in the way timewise, and the time span given for this project was significantly tighter than the first two. I had more grandiose plans for this project initially, but I resorted to some tamer artifacts due to time constraints. While I think this could have been one of my favorite projects if I had more time to work on my artifacts, ultimately school got in the way and affected the project overall. <br>
        <br>That brings us to project four. The very website you are reading from right now. It’s not the most visually appealing, is it? Well, that’s because I’m a programmer, not a website designer. Because I’m a programmer, and my challenge for this course was to over-engineer every single project, I’m doing that very thing by building my own website by hand. All the pages you see on this webpage are owned and operated by me, not Wix, not SquareSpace, not Google Pages. I did this specifically because I am not a website designer. Truthfully, this is my first time building a website in nearly 3 years. My favorite part of this website is the very weakness I have in the first place - website design. As an homage to my favorite mathematical phrase “the proof is left as an exercise for the reader,” I have personally decided that the website design will be left as an exercise for the reader. If you select “Edit Page”, you’ll be able to customize (almost) every aspect of the website. This includes font size, background color for elements, and even text color if you really wanted to. <br>
        <br>So what did I think of this course overall? Well, honestly I somewhat enjoyed the course, but I think most of that enjoyment came from these self-imposed challenges I instituted as each project showed itself. Projects one and four were my favorites, and I think the course would have been mundane if I hadn’t implemented these challenges, but that’s mainly because I had already done all of the topics we covered in this class during high school. 8/10, I definitely made it fun.

          <p>About the Author</p>
          <br>
          <p>Chris Ferrer is a Computer Programming and Applications (BA) major at FSU, but he just tells everyone he's a Computer Science major because nobody outside of the computer science department knows the difference. While Chris is currently pursuing a bachelor's degree, he is preparing to join the combined bachelor's/master's program here at FSU, meaning he will graduate with his master's degree within 4 years. Why was I writing this in 3rd person? Who knows. It's 4am and I finally got the spacing for that text centered under the image to work correctly. I'm running off insanity, a can of monster, and hopes and dreams right now. Will I unnecessarily put this on every page on my website? Hell yea.</p>
